# HyperText

HyperText is an _extremely_ ambitious project where I create my own web browser.
I will almost certainly never finish.

## Subprojects

HyperText is split into five components:

- AngleBracket - The HTML engine
- CurlyBracket - The JavaScript engine
- HyperText - The actual browser application
- FiberWire - Networking related stuff
- StyleSheet - The CSS engine

## License

HyperText, and all components, are licensed under the
