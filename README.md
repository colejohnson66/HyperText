# HyperText

HyperText is an _extremely_ ambitious project where I create my own web browser.
I will almost certainly never finish.

## Subprojects

HyperText is split into seven components:

| Component    | Description
|--------------|-------------------------------
| AngleBracket | The HTML engine
| CodePoint    | All things Unicode
| CurlyBracket | The JavaScript engine
| FiberWire    | Network related stuff
| HyperText    | The actual browser application
| RuneCode     | [Rune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.rune?view=net-6.0) related things
| StyleSheet   | The CSS engine

## License
